The sequence generator plugin provides a simple way to add sequence counters
to Grails applications. You can control the starting number, the format and
you can have different sequence counters based on application logic.

== Examples

[source,groovy]
----
    sequenceGeneratorService.initSequence('WebOrder', null, null, 100, 'WEB-%04d')

    assert sequenceGeneratorService.nextNumber('WebOrder') == 'WEB-0100'
    assert sequenceGeneratorService.nextNumber('WebOrder') == 'WEB-0101'
    assert sequenceGeneratorService.nextNumber('WebOrder') == 'WEB-0102'

    assert sequenceGeneratorService.nextNumberLong('WebOrder') == 103
    assert sequenceGeneratorService.nextNumberLong('WebOrder') == 104
----

The SequenceGeneratorService implementation is very efficient and can provide
sequential numbers to concurrent threads without problems.

The default implementation persist sequences to the database to survive server restarts.

Because it's common to have sequence properties on domain classes (customer number, order number, etc)
there is an annotation that does all the plumbing for you.
Domain classes annotated with `grails.plugins.sequence.SequenceEntity`
will get a `number` property added at compile that will be initialized with
a unique sequence number when the domain instance is saved to database.

== Configuration

The sequence generator works without any configuration.
Sensible defaults are used if no configuration is found.
You can customise the sequences with the following parameters in Config.groovy:

=== Number format

`sequence.(name).format` (default %d)

Format to use for sequence numbers. The name is the name of the sequence (simple name of the domain class).
The number is formatted with `String#format(String, Object...)`.

    sequence.Customer.format = "%05d"

=== Starting number

`sequence.(name).start` (default 1)

The starting number when a sequence is first initialized. The name is the name of the sequence (simple name of the domain class).

    sequence.Customer.start = 1001

=== Flush interval

`sequence.flushInterval` (default 60)

This configuration parameter is only available when using the `DefaultSequenceGenerator`.
It specifies the number of seconds to wait before flushing in-memory sequence counters to the database.

    sequence.flushInterval = 30

== Annotation @SequenceEntity

If you have a sequence property on a domain class, for example a customer number property, you could add code
in beforeValidate() or beforeInsert() that assigns a sequence number with `sequenceGeneratorService.nextNumber(this.class)`.
But the `grails.plugins.sequence.SequenceEntity` annotation makes this much easier. It does all the plumbing for you.

[source,groovy]
.Customer.groovy
----
@SequenceEntity
class Customer {
    ...
}
----

An AST Transformation adds a `String` property called *number* to the domain class at compile time.
The property will by default have `maxSize:10`, `unique:true`, and `blank:false` constraints.
But you can override this in the annotation.

[source,groovy]
.CustomerOrder.groovy
----
@SequenceEntity(property = "orderNumber", maxSize = 20, blank = false, unique = "true") <1>
class CustomerOrder {
    ...
}
----
<1> Note that the `unique` attribute is a `String`, not a `boolean`.

The AST Transformation will also add code in `beforeValidate()` that sets the `number` property if it is not already set.

So the only thing you really have to do is to annotate your domain class with `@SequenceEntity` and the number
property will be set to a new unique number before the domain instance is saved to the database.

[NOTE]
====
Maybe you ask: "Why not use database sequences?"

Well, a database sequence use numbers only and is very efficient but not so flexible.
This plugin is more flexible and lets you use String properties and prefix/suffix the number with characters.
You can use sub-sequences to generate different numbers depending on application logic.
Maybe domain instances of one category should use another sequence that the default.
This plugin also let you change the sequence number programatically.
For example you could reset the sequence to start with YYYY0001 on the first of January every year.

== SequenceGeneratorService

With `SequenceGeneratorService` you can interact with sequences. The following methods are available:

`Sequence initSequence(String name, String group, Long tenant, Long start, String format)`

Create a new sequence counter and initialize it with a starting number (default 1).

[options="header",cols="1,4"]
|===
| Parameter         | Description
| name              | Name of sequence
| group (optional)  | If you need multiple sequences for the same domain class based on some application logic you can use groups to create sub-sequences
| tenant (optional) | Tenant ID in a multi-tenant environment
| start (optional)  | The sequence will start at this number
| format (optional) | The number format returned by `nextNumber()` uses `String#format(String, Object...)`
|===

`Sequence initSequence(Class clazz, String group, Long tenant, Long start, String format)`

Same as above but takes a domain class instead of sequence name. `Class#getSimpleName()` will be used as sequence name.

`String nextNumber(String name, String group, Long tenant)`

Returns the next number in the specified sequence. The number is formatted with the sequence's defined format.

[options="header",cols="1,4"]
|===
| Parameter         | Description
| name              | Name of sequence
| group (optional)  | Optional sub-sequence if multiple sequence counters exists for the same name / domain class
| tenant (optional) | Tenant ID in a multi-tenant environment
|===

`String nextNumber(Class clazz, String group, Long tenant)`

Same as above but takes a domain class instead of sequence name. Class#getSimpleName() will be used as sequence name.

`Long nextNumberLong(String name, String group, Long tenant)`

If you don't need formatted numbers and just want a number sequence you can use `nextNumberLong()`.
It works the same way as `nextNumber()` but returns a `Long` instead of a formatted `String`.

`boolean setNextNumber(Long currentNumber, Long newNumber, String name, String group, Long tenant)`

Sets the next number for a sequence counter.
To avoid concurrency issues you must specify both the current number and the number you want to change to.
If current number is not equal to the specified current number the new number will not be set.
True is returned if the sequence number was updated.

[options="header",cols="1,4"]
|===
| Parameter         | Description
| currentNumber     | The caller's view of what the current number is
| newNumber         | The number to set. The next call to `nextNumber()` will get this number
| name              | Name of sequence to set number for
| group (optional)  | Optional sub-sequence if multiple sequence counters exists for the same name / domain class
| tenant (optional) | Tenant ID in a multi-tenant environment
|===

`Iterable<SequenceStatus> statistics(Long tenant)`

[options="header",cols="1,4"]
|===
| Parameter         | Description
| tenant (optional) | Tenant ID in a multi-tenant environment
|===

Return statistics for all sequences defined in the application for a given tenant.

== REST Controller

`SequenceGeneratorController` provides two methods that accepts JSON requests to interact with sequences.

WARNING: Make sure you protect this controller with appropriate access control!

`list(String name, String group)`

Returns a list of sequences in JSON format. See `SequenceGeneratorService#getStatistics()`

`update(String name, String group, Long current, Long next)`

Accepts POST requests that updates the next number for a sequence. See `SequenceGeneratorService#setNextNumber()`

== JMX

You can check sequence statistics from a JMX client using the registered JMX bean `:name=SequenceGeneratorService,type=services`.

== Changes

1.2:: Added 'group' property to the SequenceStatus class. This makes it possible to retrieve group name when parsing statistics.
      Also added an admin UI for setting next available sequence number (controller: 'sequenceGenerator', action: 'index')
1.1:: Renamed SequenceNumber.number column to `sequence_number` because `number` is a reserved word in Oracle DB.

[TIP]
====
When upgrading from 1.0 to 1.1 the *number* property was renamed to *sequence_number*.
The database migration plugin does not handle column renaming so well.
It generates dropColumn and addColumn statements, resulting in data-loss.
The following script is a modified version for MySQL:

[source,groovy]
----
changeSet(author: "nobody", id: "1417018030553-1") {
    renameColumn(tableName: 'sequence_number', oldColumnName: 'number', newColumnName: 'sequence_number', columnDataType: 'bigint')
}
----

1.0:: First public release

== Known Issues

* The current implementation (DefaultSequenceGenerator) keep sequences in memory for performance reasons and therefore it cannot be used in clustered environments.
The (experimental) *sequence-generator-rest* and *sequence-generator-redis* are designed to work in clustered environments, see link below.

== Road Map

* Implement a second sequence generator that communicates with an external micro service.
  (maybe built with Spring Boot and Redis). This would add clustering support that the current in-memory implementation `DefaultSequenceGenerator` lacks.
**  *Work In Progress:* See https://github.com/goeh/grails-sequence-generator-rest[sequence-generator-rest] for an example of an external sequence generator service.
**  *Work In Progress:* See https://github.com/goeh/grails-sequence-generator-redis[sequence-generator-redis] a sequence generator backed by Redis.
